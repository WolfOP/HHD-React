# UI Overhaul TODO

This checklist outlines the steps required to modernise the interface with a dark glossy aesthetic and purple accents. Each step should be reviewed on both desktop and mobile.


- [x] Audit existing components and identify hard‑coded max widths or margins.
- [x] Expand layout containers so content spans the full viewport width.
- [x] Apply a dark gradient background with subtle purple tones for depth.
- [x] Update header and footer styles to match the new glossy look.

- [ ] Replace placeholder images with higher‑quality assets where available.
- [ ] Review typography and spacing for accessibility and readability.
- [ ] Ensure responsive behaviour for navigation and interactive elements.
- [ ] Test across mobile and desktop to remove any unwanted scrollbars or borders.
- [ ] Perform final accessibility and lint checks before release.
